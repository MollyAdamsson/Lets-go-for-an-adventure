# The adventure of the Damned Willow Forest!

* This is a text adventure game based off of my own imagination. Worth mentioning is the fact that it has some inspiration taken from The lord of the rings. The player is presented with the context of them standing outside of a forest, and they have to go through it if they want to go back home. The sign at the edge of the forest explains that they will encounter some obstacles on their way. Well inside the player will meet everythig between a goblin to a witch, each of these characters will offer something valuable. At the end the player will meet a Wizard, he wants to know if the player has seen his treasure, and if so the Wizard will help the player to get to the end of the forest so that he can go home, if not the player has to get over the wild stream by themself.

## Flowchart

* I have created a flowchart to help myself plan out the bascis of the game. This helped me a lot when I started to plan out which path was connected to which and so on. When looking at the chart one can understand the basic knowledge of what to do.

* The original one I made was not the one that resulted in the finished product, I realised that some of the steps that I first planned out was a bit unnecessary. And I also felt that i wanted to make different paths for frequent players.

* This is the one I ended up using:

### Path ways

* Different pathways will be presented during the game. Each one will take the player deeper inside the woods and each one will give the player the oppertunity to choose where to go. One patway has two pathways connected to it, if the player choose path 1 they will meet a goblin and if the player choose path 2 they will eventueally meet a witch.

### Solve riddle

* The first obstacle is a riddle, the player has to solve it before they can continue. If they get the riddle wrong they loose the game.

### Meeting the characters

* The player will get the chance of meeting a goblin, the player has to fight it and if they win they get a badge of honor to collect and then they can continue to meet the wizard. 
* The player will also get the chance of meeting a witch, she will give the player a few words of wisdom and then proceed to give them a "Book of wisdom" and the player collects it as well. 
* The player will then get the chance of meeting a wizard, he will ask if the player has seen his treasure. If so and the player gives i to him he will help them to the end of the forest. If not - he says something snarky and disappears.

### The wild stream

* If the player doesn't help the wizard they are left alone to deal with the wild stream.
* It is not that hard to get passed it and the player will soon after that see the end of the forest.

### The end of the forest

* When they arrive at the end they are greeted by a couple of forest gnomes.
* The gnomes chant and exclaims happieness that the player made it out alive.
* The player will after that be informed with that the game is over and they have the oppertunity to play again if they want.

### Error messages

* If the player enters an invalid answer they will be presented with an error message.
* They can look a bit different but here are a few of them:

### Game over

* There is a chance to retry the game if the player wants to:

### Features

* I decided to add some color to the text to make it easier for the player.
* It mostly had to do with it looking a bit cooler, and so that it would be
easier on the eye if there was something separating the different functions 
and sections.
* The text is green when something is good/the game is just starting 
* The dialouges are a cyan color
* When meeting the goblin/error messages are red. (To indicate taht something is bad)
* And the narrative text are a magenta color.

For example:
image 1 on text
image 2 of text

## Features left to implement
* I would like to add some more background story, to make it a bit more interesting
* I would like to add some music
* I would like to add so that the player can add to their health
* I would like to add a healing potion if the player died
* I would like to add one more obstacle to get through
* I would like to add a typing function, so that text rolls out on the 
screen when the player enters a new section.

## Technologies Used

* Gitpod
* Gitpod

* Every path/character is well connected

## Credits

### content
* I used Code Institute's Love Sandwiches Walkthrough for guidance with code structure and deployment steps.
* To change the color of the text I used ANSI color. Page from Stackoverflow helping it explain it to me found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4842424/list-of-ansi-color-escape-sequences)
